Objective:

The Vehicle Tracking System with GPS and GSM aims to provide real-time monitoring and tracking of vehicles for enhanced safety, security, and operational efficiency.
(The system uses GPS (Global Positioning System) to determine the vehicle's exact location and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) to transmit this information to a central server (or)
mobile phone via SMS or internet-based communication.

Key Features:
Real-time Tracking:

Allows continuous monitoring of the vehicle's location in real-time on a map using GPS data.
GSM Communication:

Uses GSM technology to transmit the vehicle’s coordinates to a server or designated mobile numbers, providing seamless communication.
Geo-fencing:

Alerts when the vehicle enters or leaves a predefined geographical area, providing better control and security.
Speed Monitoring:

Tracks the vehicle’s speed and sends alerts if it exceeds predefined speed limits.
Route Deviation Alerts:

Sends notifications when the vehicle deviates from its planned route.
SMS Notifications:

Provides status updates via SMS, such as location, speed, and alerts for unauthorized movements.
Data Logging:

Stores past movement data for later analysis, allowing for route optimization and performance tracking.
Emergency Alerts:

An SOS button or a system that detects accidents and sends alerts to predefined contacts for immediate assistance.
